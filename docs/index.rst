Welcome to kneed's documentation!
=================================

This is the documentation for the `kneed <https://github.com/arvkevi/kneed>`__ Python package.
Given `x` and `y` arrays, `kneed` attempts to identify the knee/elbow point of a line fit to the data.
The knee/elbow is defined as the point of the line with maximum curvature.  

For more information about how each of the parameters affect identification of knee points, check out :ref:`parameters`.  
For a full reference of the API, head over to the :ref:`api`.
